# thing-namer
names things (by turning lists of similar things into a markov chain)

I just call

`python3 name-thing.py [SIMILAR_THINGS_FILE] [NUMBER_OF_THINGS_TO_NAME]`

so that could be, like,

`python3 name-thing.py sample_things/currencies.txt 10`

and you'd get

```
helari
lerucali
ma
vana
dene
gr
veou
yvin
doliananatywnitusikwariual
chma
```

You can probably use python2 also, but like why would you
